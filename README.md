# AirBnB clone

# Description
AirBnB clone is a web application that is still under development. It is a clone of AirBnB, and it integrates database storage, a back-end APIs, and front-end interfacing. Currently, only the back-end console has been implemented.

# Console
The console is an interactive command-line interpreter designed to manage the backend of an AirBnB clone application. It provides a user-friendly interface for handling and manipulating all classes utilized by the application.
# How to use the Console
The AirBnB console can be run both interactively and non-interactively. To run the console in interactive mode you need to execute the command ./console.py in your terminal. This will start the console and you will see a prompt (hbnb) indicating that the console is ready to receive commands. You can then enter a command and press enter to execute it.
```$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help
